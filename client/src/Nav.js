/*Review: why setting the navbar heading to sticky is needed to allow the pages to be clicked */

/*Note: future problem that needs to be resolved: For some reason, the navbar won't work with having a larger z index than the div cards. This is bad because I want the navbar covering the cards, not the other way around. Managed to find an acceptable solution by using media queries to move the content downwards when it goes to phone screens, so the user will just need to scroll all the way up to access the navbar.*/
